Start by adding a customer name. This field is not required.

Next add the Order Amount. This field is required and can be used for the order total before
delivery fee or for the value of the order.

There are three options to calculating the delivery fee. The Flat Delivery Fee is an amount
that will be added to the total, regardless of distance or valuation. The Rate Per Mile is 
the amount that will be charged for the distance calculated between the Pickup Address and
the Delivery Address. The % Commission will be a percentage from 1 to 100 that is calulated
based on the Order Amount (before delivery fees are added). You may select any combination
of the options, or use all three.

The final inputs needed are a Pickup Address and a Delivery Address. Search for those in the
corresponding input boxes. You may start by typing the address and selecting the correct address
from the dropdown menu when it appears. You may also type in a point of interest. Finish your
input by selecting the correct address when it appears in the dropdown menu.

When you have selected and provided all the necessary inputs, press the `Calculate` button.

In the box at the bottom of the screen, the total mileage is displayed. Each option you selected
will be calculated and displayed in the appropriate box. At the very bottom is a grand total of 
the Order Amount, plus all additional delivery fees.
